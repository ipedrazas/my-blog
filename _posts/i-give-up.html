Today my kid has told me that my pronunciation is rubbish... The fact that he&#39;s spanish and he has been living in London for 5 months looks like enough to patronise his poor dad for not having a perfect english accent. I know, I know, kids will be kids and they learn much faster than (specially) me. Still, it amazes me to see how quickly he picked it up. All my previous experiences with spaniards coming to UK and struggling with english have been blown away by my kid.<p /><div>Impressive!</div><p /><div>Still, I will not speak english at home or not in front of him at least... and yes, he&#39;s delighted to be better than me with english. Nice.</div>
