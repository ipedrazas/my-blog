<div>When building :blibb I&#39;ve been having something very present: how crap the web is for blind people. Not seriously. Do you want to experience the web as blind people do? Install Google Chrome if you don&#39;t have it already, add the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn">ChromeVox</a> add-in, enable it and visit a website like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>). Close you eyes and tell me if you had a pleasant experience (if you do, I will add you straight away to my BDSM circle).</div> <p />One of the most ambitious tasks with <a href="http://www.blibb.net">:blibb</a> is to provide a pleasant experience when accessing content: to everybody (yes, that includes blind people).<p /><div> Now, content is content is content, but it&#39;s not about the content but how the content is consumed (reading, listening, watching...). To put in in plain English: the content is tightly coupled to the device you use to consume that content (it&#39;s not the same a TV than an iPhone).</div> <p /><div>So does it make sense to have content per device? not really, but because making content for a single device is &quot;easy&quot; and it can be very ludicrous (as Apple has proved with its App. Store ecosystem) we end up with content created for a particular kind of devices.</div> <p /><div> So, why <a href="http://www.blibb.net">:blibb</a> is different? first, because we are device agnostic, or let&#39;s put it in this way, to enable content for a new device in <a href="http://www.blibb.net">:blibb</a> it&#39;s much easier. Raise your hand if you remember the big (lie)  promise of creating your content in XML and creating later on transformation to render that content in multiple devices though an XSLT transformation.</div> <p /><div>Yes, the XSLT wars left a lot of dead bodies everywhere. The idea was good, the implementation a nightmare.</div><p /><div>Now, one of the most terrible side effects of the XSLT wars was that money matters more than content, so, if you&#39;re not going to bring sh*t loads of cash, I&#39;m not bother about creating content for you. Well, that&#39;s not nice.</div> <p /><div>Can <a href="http://www.blibb.net">:blibb</a> bring some light to this darkness? I really hope so.</div><p /><div>There are two specific areas <a href="http://www.blibb.net">:blibb</a> is trying to make a difference. First, the audio view O_0 Which is nothing else than an Android App that reads the content (yet-another-screen-reader?) not really, because the audio is streamed from the server. The second one, is to push content that can be switched to an A11y view.</div> <p /><div>Wish me luck, because it&#39;s a hell of a task!</div>
