One of the most challenging parts if my 12 Marathons project is writing about it. I know, I know, I should focus on running, smiling and keeping my mouth tight shout... But I wanted to share my thoughts and ideas.<p /><div>Because the nature of my situation I cannot have &quot;my place&quot; to write. I do have Scrivener, but since I have only one computer with it and my chances of being at that computer with enough time and energy to write are very little, so I had to find a replacement.</div> <p /><div>Dropbox would be a perfect candidate, but sometimes I&#39;m not using my won computer so, it doesn&#39;t work that well, and yes, I could use the web interface but it&#39;s not that friendly... What I want it&#39;s a place where I have all my writing, have all the info that I&#39;ve been collecting and I can write/edit/organise my writing.</div> <p /><div>Sounds easy, uh? it is not. Google Docs is good for writing, specially now that they have offline writing. but it&#39;s not that great for organising data. I use Springpad too, which is great for organising, but crap as a writing tool (not saying that you cannot write, that you can, but you could not write a book on a &quot;Notes&quot; basis).</div> <p /><div>So, thinking of Bookloop, it&#39;s pretty clear that it has to bee something cool as Google Docs but with the organisation possibilities of SpringPad (Who said that I didn&#39;t aim for the stars?).</div> <p /><div>Unfortunately I have no time to spend with Bookloop now, but I&#39;m learning a lot of what it should be and very specially what it should not be.</div>
