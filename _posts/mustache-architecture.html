Erm, nope, I&#39;m not growing a moustache... And nope, not planning on talking about the best way to let your facial hair grow in a particular way. What I want to talk a bit it&#39;s about my personal project, and specially, the architecture.<p /><div>Some time ago I started the development of Bookloop, a monster as little as a little application that allows me to create and organise my writings, or as big as a platform to market, sell, and consume texts.</div> <p /><div>What it&#39;s interesting is the approach I took when I started developing it. I didn&#39;t have much time for anything, so, I started with html (actually, it&#39;s html5, but it doesn&#39;t matter). My idea was: to do something I could improve little by little but worked from day 1. This means, not big refactoring.... anywhere.</div> <p /><div>I didn&#39;t want to make big decisions while building the proof of concept, but I didn&#39;t want to build something that I had to scrap once the PoC was done. So... I&#39;ve built the a frontend in pure html5 consuming json datasouces. These datasources were a mix of hardcoded javascript values, php and java servlets.</div> <p /><div>The good thing about building the application this way is that I can replace things little by little without much hassle. For example, a php page was converted into a java servlet that evolved to scala in a few weeks. From the application point of view, the change was the port of the url... nice.</div> <p /><div>The last change I&#39;ve been implementing is to start using Mustache, a very simple template engine. The good thing of the approach I took is that moving into mustache didn&#39;t take much effort, which, oh God, it looks like the pattern behind BookLoop: I do not have much time, so, I cannot waste my little time in things like releases, builds or whatevers, I need to be productive, and quick... and I did using html and javascript.</div> <p /><div>Joy of joys!</div>
