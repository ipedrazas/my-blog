Easy. Bankers, as any other person who works with objectives, will get paid an undisclosed (and surely pretty obscene) amount of money in case he achieves his target.Â <p /><div>In the case of Bankers (or almost any other person) those objectives are bond to growing the business or let&#39;s speak clearly: the will get paid the bonus if they manage to make the bank to increase the revenue.</div> <p /><div>Now, us, poor non bankers, have an issue: we&#39;re in a BIG recession. Funny enough, bankers are very lucky because it seems that the whole world (and the stars) are aligned to make them even more richer. How? because Oh Dear! the countries are in (BIG) Debt, so, they need to sell Public Debt... Now here it comes the ECB and offers to the bank loans so they will be able to lend more and doing so, releasing the pressure from the markets.</div> <p /><div>Now, the European Central Bank is lending money with an interest of 1% and guess what? Public Debt, like the Spanish one, has an interest of 5/6% so, by just getting the money from the ECB and buying public debt, bankers are making between 4 and 5% benefit. Niiiiice!</div> <p /><div>Suddenly, reaching those gruesome objectives seems easier than ever: they just keep asking for more moeny to the ECB to buy more Public Debt and making their own bank even more rich.</div><p /> <div>So, here we are, the bankers are paid the bonuses because the ECB has managed to find a way of giving them free money to the expense of the different countries Public Debt. Why teh ECB is not lending straight to the countries? easy, because the ECB is managed for bankers, not politicians (even some of them are both to make corruption even a more sophisticated game).</div> <p /><div>So, are we paying the bonuses of these big fat bankers? yes! it doesn&#39;t really matter if the bank is public or private, because what they&#39;re doing is getting cheap money to buy out debt that we will have to pay back with our taxes.</div> <p /><div>Genius Master Plan!</div><p /><div>When I grow up, I want to be as smart as these bankers!</div>
