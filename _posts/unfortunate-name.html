Have you stumble upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">hateoas</a>? not the best name, really. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">Hateoas</a> is, in plain english, an api that behaves like a website. This is, the api has an entry point and from then you can discover the rest of the awesome things that the api provide. The formal definition? Hateoas is an abbreviation for Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. The principle is that a client interacts with a network application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers.<p /><div>Discovery is important and I&#39;ve been considering the option of building a search engine for API calls. Lame? maybe, but not that long ago I remember people wondering why in the name of God you wanted something like yahoo or altavista (a place where you search for links??) when you could save your bookmarks IN YOUR COMPUTER!</div> <p /><div>Exactly the kind of person that could foresee the future. Btw, I did go to Altavista to double check that they were still around and I even did a search (<a href="http://us.yhs4.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?p=google&amp;fr=altavista&amp;fr2=sfp&amp;iscqry=">this one</a>). Not surprised to see that the result came from Yahoo!.</div> <p /><div>I love search and I love APIs, in a way, <a href="http://blibb.net">:blibb</a> is the result of that love for APIs. A way to define your own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a> and expose it as your own API. But let&#39;s not get sidetracked here, we were talking about search and APIs. Does it makes sense to have an index for the APIs of the world? think about it. Imagine an API (because a search engine for APIs should be an API itself, right?) that allows you (or your systems) to go and search for an API call that will relate to a particular query. Stupid? maybe, but think about it again bearing in mind the idea of HATEOAS.</div> <p /><div>My children always ask for examples, so, let me give you a simple example. Imagine that I have a little app that suggest places according to different parameters like weather, location, friends or whatever thing I could think of. Yes, the suggestion is based on the context. As we know the context changes constantly, and yes, every person has a different context.</div> <p /><div>We could build an app that has a predefined set of services that provide data that is used to build up the suggestion pool, but what if the services don&#39;t provide any accurate information? With a search of services we could build the dynamic suggestion engine. The app. goes our and selects a number of services based on our previous choices and display some suggestions. Even better, the search results provide the entry points to the APIs that provide services that will provide the data. Crawling the web is turned in crawling the services and the data that they provide because keep in mind this, it&#39;s all about the data and the different ways of finding it.</div> <p /><div>What do you think? far too esoteric? too complicated? too distant from the user?</div><p /><div>Discussion is on!</div>
