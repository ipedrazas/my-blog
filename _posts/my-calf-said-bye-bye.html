This week was the 55k week, this is, running during the week the same distance that I will be running one of the 2 of the 3 days of the CBXR. Unfortunately, my right calf has said that he&#39;ll be back next week or so, and that it&#39;s going to take a break... Fair enough, I&#39;m not going to force anything, I know I cannot do much so, I will chill (perhaps a bit of swimming? strength training? no training at all?).<p /><div>In the meantime, I&#39;m reading, reading, reading (what a surprise) and yup, writing, writing and writing (I know, not in my blog, even I would say, not in this blog...) Very exciting times ahead, even it looks like that once more, it&#39;s me against the rest of the world (hey, like Scott Pilgrim!!!).</div> <p /><div>Anything else? oh, yes... Jubilee Line sucks!</div>
