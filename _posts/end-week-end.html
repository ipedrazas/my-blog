There&#39;s always a climax in every weekend, mine was this last Sunday at 4:30 am... But let&#39;s start at the very beginning: highlight of the week: tube chaos on Friday evening: Text from wife saying that she wasn&#39;t going to make it to the nursery triggered the Plan B. A quick call to Gorka&#39;s babysitter to ask her please, please, please to go and get the baby... &quot;no probs, on our way&quot;.<p /><div>So, everything is fine, right? erm, no! the fact that she&#39;s not registered as a person who can collect Nico could make the whole operation to crumble... Another quick call and me deciding to run until I got a green light to go down under, which is not Australia, but the not-so-reliable London Tube.</div> <p /><div>20 minutes after the call and me arriving to Tower Hill everything was sorted out. She got the baby, Wife was still stuck at Euston and yes indeed, Tower Hill Tube station was as chaotic as expected. Quick decision then to run to Embankment where I could get the Bakerloo line... Unless, of course, it was even worse than Tower Hill... Riiiiiiight!</div> <p /><div>Text from Wife letting me know that she was sound and safe home with her baby and me that, why not, I could run all the way home, so I did, and after almost 17 km of trotting around, I managed to arrive home to discover oh joy of joys, that it took me 20 minutes less than last week where (yes, once again) tube didn&#39;t work well (again).</div> <p /><div>The rest of the weekend could be summarized as follow: trying to sleep, hitting the roof on Saturday night at 4 am with baby yelling and zombie wife and myself spending the rest of the Sunday trying to snooze here and there without managing.</div> <p /><div>All in all a good weekend, tiring, but good :D</div>
