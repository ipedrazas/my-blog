Now that my Kindle is dead... I&#39;m considering the option to replace it with yet another kindle or with a <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/nookcolor">Nookcolor</a>. Not sure about that because... I&#39;m not sure it will be as good as my kindle, which brings me back to my previous issue: a kindle, but which one? After my experience with Amazon Support, I think I should go for the 3G version from the uk site... but the big screen of the DX is glorious, so... what then? Dx is sold only by Amazon.com, so, it&#39;s me adding another kindle to my collection (which it&#39;s starting to look like my iPod collection) or what I call pokemon gadget (get&#39;em all!).<p /><div>Sad, I know... but I really miss my kindle :(</div>
