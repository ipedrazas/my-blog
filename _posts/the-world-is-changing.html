I&#39;ve not lived much, but I&#39;ve lived enough to witness that a rise it&#39;s always followed by a fallen. Now, don&#39;t get too philosophical that there&#39;s no need.<p /><div>In the beginning was the word, and then it came Google and indexed it, so we can search and find it. Cool, then people start blogging it. Then, we needed of someone to remind us who our real friends were and who were mere acquaintances, that&#39;s why we needed facebook, because names and phone numbers are great but an image is worth a thousand contacts, specially if it&#39;s The Image.</div> <p /><div>With twitter we recover the joy of telling the world that we were awake, that we were going to sleep, or simply, to the loo. Great!Â </div><p /><div>But if we look at the big picture here, we&#39;ll see that every time the market looked like saturated a new player comes into the game to make things more unstable... or not (it does). And we&#39;ve seen, in the last 10 years quite a few of those: amazon, google (yes, really, google came second), facebook, twitter, and all the rest.</div> <p /><div>What about the others? well, we have Yahoo, which is that company that it would be the anti-midas, do you remember that king that everything he touched turned gold, well, Yahoo does the opposite, every time Yahoo buys a company, it goes busted.</div> <p /><div>Anyway, what about skype (those are the ants, working hard during summer while others like digg enjoy the summer and get the solitaire in winter), Flickr (I know, it&#39;s owned by yahoo, but the guys from flickr were intelligent, they made a deal were yahoo would put the money but they would never EVER could make any important decision. Or other companies that have been around for ages giving good service: sourceforge, or the people from Apache, for example... How many hours of work these guys saved me because they had already the source code of THAT function I had to use. Awesome!</div> <p /><div>So, in one hand we get the big cows getting fatter and fatter. Amazon doesn&#39;t sell books anymore, it sells everything! from pans to nappies, even wine and disk space... They even sell clouds! Not going to saya word about google, just in case they get angry with me and publish all the dirty pictures I have in picassa... Not a signle word for Microsoft who are not key players anymore: they managed to go from the very top, to offer solutions for people who uses computers with keyboards and all that clutter (my 8 old kid thought laptops were iPads with keyboards: and you cannot play Angry Birds with most of them! useless!). Yeah, Ms had hotmail, messenger: that program that they thought it would be king of kings between teenagers and kids until Rim came and sweep them out. Yes, Rim, the ones who use to make posh telephones for bankers killed the ms. messenger. Fair is to say, that the own people of Microsoft update after update looked like they really wanted to be fired.</div> <p /><div>So, what&#39;s the point of this very big post (which started in the previous one with a very nice quote from the Lord of The Rings... The idea is to remember to the few people who read this blog that Nope, not everything has been invented, and yes, those who are on top today might not be there tomorrow, and of course in 5 years we will wonder who we could not have guessed that the next revolution will come from xxxx.</div> <p /><div>If you ask me about those Xs, I cannot answer. I do not know what the next revolution will be, but I do know that things will change once again, and new players will come into the game and old players will go... And yes, I know all that about geolocation, mobile, etc, and I agree, there&#39;s a hell of a long way to synthesis and that&#39;s were we&#39;re going, now, I&#39;m not going to call for a revolution until someone makes something that will save to go in the Tube every morning smelling other people&#39;s lack of hygiene... Hold on! I know how to solve that smelly problem! it&#39;s called bicycle and I have one: it&#39;s red and 20 years old!</div>
