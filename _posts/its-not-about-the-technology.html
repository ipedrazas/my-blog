But DAMN, the technology sometimes helps like &quot;LOADS!&quot;<p /><div>Let me explain my problem (or at least one of them). I&#39;m working on a Prototype that uses MongoDB as a backend (it uses other stuff as well, but the MongoDB is where the &quot;situation&quot; is).</div> <p /><div>Ok, this is the story. I have a piece of data that I need to save into my MongoDB. I know exactly how to save that data. This means that using MongoDB console I can save my data the way I want to. it&#39;s important because knowing that you can do something is very important.</div> <p /><div>Ok, next step: I need to have a user interface since users are not very keen on terminals nor consoles. So I need a web server. Fine, I got plenty of those. Then I will need to write some code that will gather all the data from the user and it will save it into my MongoDB backend. Easy? well, kind of.</div> <p /><div>For Frontend development I&#39;d go for Python. Fast, easy, good, reliable. Perfect. Unfortunately, the python ODMs available for Mongo are not that great... and they do not let me save the data the way I want to. That&#39;s a bit of a bummer!</div> <p /><div>I could use Java, that I know that it lets me save the data the way I want to, but Java is not the nicest thing to work with when talking about frontends... So, here&#39;s my dilema. What do I do?</div> <p /><div>I could use java for backedn and frontend... but I don&#39;t want to.</div><div>I could use java for the backend and python for the fronteend... but it makes thing a bit too complicated for a prototype.</div> <div>I could use jython... but that&#39;s not going to happen.</div><p /><div>so? well, my approach is veryÂ promiscuous. I will write low level python code once I know that the idea is feasible (meaning that I will have some java tests that prove that the approach is valid).</div> <p /><div>I hope I will have something ready by the end of this short week... but we shall see.</div>
