Here we are, after having spent Christmas in Canet de Mar, a small town by the sea at 40 km of Barcelona, enjoying the English weather at the maximum.<p /><div>I had wondered how many times the weather changes in London during a day, but I could not really find a way (an easy/lazy one) to check for real how many times this joyful weather changed... Until I bumped into &quot;If This Then That&quot; et voila! we do have an answer: yesterday it rained 8 times!</div> <p /><div>So, in case you follow me on Twitter, you&#39;d surely have seen tweets like the one in the image, and I&#39;m pretty sure that you could not believe that I was going to go out to run so often (I&#39;m sorry, I actually didn&#39;t realise until it was too late what a misleading message it was. From here, I publicly apologise).</div> <p /><div>Anyway, you can see in the screenshot that yes, it rained 8 times, which is quite a lot of rain! For the record, I&#39;ve disabled the IFTTT trigger so I&#39;m not be bothering you anymore *about me getting wet in the rain, at least).</div> <p /><p /> <p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
