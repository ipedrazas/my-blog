<div>How do you control your pace when you&#39;re running? well, I don&#39;t use a heart rate monitor which a fair nice gadget that won&#39;t keep you at your zone, but at least you will know how far off you are. What I do is to listen to my breathing. If I&#39;m breathing a calm peaceful way it means that I&#39;m all right.</div> <p /><div>This is my secret for Long Distance Running: peaceful breathing.</div><p /><div>I know it&#39;s always a bit difficult at the beginning when people press on and you feel strong so why not? well, if you find yourself with a not that peaceful breathing you know straight away that unless the run is short, you will suffer later on. So, next time you start running and feel that your breath rhythm is not as chilled as you would like, slow down. Lift your foot from the accelerator and enjoy the run (specially at the very end!)</div> <p /><div>GO!</div>
