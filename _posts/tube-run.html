Tough Friday fro me. First because before leaving home I thought about taking my kit so I could run back home (I&#39;m really looking forward running back with my new mini-rucksack). I didn&#39;t, so when I arrived to Canary Wharf station to find it packed and closed (yep, tube paradoxes happen...) I started to regret not having my running kit with me (with or without rucksack). Worse even when DLR decided that they had to close Bank because a faulty train there (!!!!), so, my journey that usually takes 1h, took longer that <b>If I Had Run Home!</b><p /><div>So, it&#39;s not about new year resolutions or anything like that, it&#39;s about keeping my sanity: I really hate to find myself plus a massive crowd stuck in any of the Public Transport of London.</div><p /><div>Starting today, Monsieur is running back home!</div>
