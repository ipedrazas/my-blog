<div>Place: <a href="http://hmv.com/">HMV</a> @ Canary Wharf</div><p /><p />&quot;Can I help you?&quot; A well trained sales assistant has asked me this morning.<div><br /><div>&quot;Actually yes, I hope so&quot; I answered trying to hide my smile... &quot;I like to run you know... and I have this friend that since he got an iPad his performance has gone over the top, like a 2% more or something like this&quot;</div> <p /><div>&quot;Sorry, did you say to run?&quot; At this point I looked at him like if he was asking me if I were Real Madrid supporter, or even worse, a ManU one!</div><p /><div>&quot;Yeah, yeah, you know, this bloke is training for some crazy triathlon, like swimming and cycling and then running, but I&#39;m only interested in running so I don&#39;t need a waterproof iPad or anything, just a plain one&quot;</div> <p /><div>The poor guy looked pretty confused, but he went back to the iPhone suggestion.</div></div><p /><div>&quot;Nah, I&#39;m pretty sure he didn&#39;t say iPhone, why should he need a telephone to run? I&#39;m positive he said iPad, why do you have iPhones available but you sold out all the iPads?&quot;</div> <p /><div>&quot;Actually we do have iPads, but unfortunately we don&#39;t sell iPhones, but you can get one next door&quot; that&#39;s because there&#39;s a card phone house next to HMV (and a Vodafone, and....).</div> <p /><div>&quot;So, this thing of Nike+, do you have the kit or do I have to go to JD&quot; I said pointing to JD, which is the shop in front of HMV &quot;because if it&#39;s something for running I guess...&quot;</div> <p /><div>&quot;Oh, no, no, sir, we do have Nike+ kits, but I&#39;m still not 100% sure of what you&#39;re looking for&quot; At this point I explained the whole thing again, of me having a friend who since he got an iPad he&#39;s running performance has just gone unbelievable... The guy shows me the iPod nano and ask me if I don&#39;t mean that, because the iPad is far too big to run with&quot; and he points to the iPads which, yes, they are far too big to run with... Â &quot;Maybe he runs with a rucksack and puts the thing in it?&quot; The guy tells me that he would go for the nano with the Nike+</div> <p /><div>At that point I can barely hold my laugh and just said that I will give him a call and ask him which iPad has got the chunky one, or the tiny one, and leave the shop...</div><p /><div>I know, I know... I should not be making fun of these guys, but come one, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll be telling his mates that this stupid customer came in today asking for an iPad to run with... so, we draw, right?</div> <p /><div>These are the people you can blame of me taking the piss: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/marioescorza">Mario Escorza</a> (aka <a href="http://marioescorza.com/">no iPad no Ironman</a>) and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/xoanmi">Xoanmi</a> (I just keep complaining about how hot is in <a href="http://www.sportgeek.es/">Barcelona in February</a>).</div>
