I&#39;ve spent some days hacking into the joys of Node.js and... well, it makes a lot of sense to use Node.js as a key player in your SOA architecture. Usually you have to build your services using expensive monsters like Websphere or Weblogic, but Â I&#39;m pretty sure that any webservice duel between any of those two dinosaurs and node, node would kick ass.<p /><div>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any of those ones here and it&#39;s a pity because I would love to do the benchmark. Here we use Oracle Application Server that even my dog&#39;s webserver can make it bite the dust (yes, it&#39;s that bad, but hey, it&#39;s enterprise!).</div> <p /><div>For the last year I&#39;ve been using json as my data format and http as my protocol. I know, you have funky things like JMS and stuff... Someone here was talking yesterday about an ESB (HA!), but the greatness of http and json services is that you build and you build pretty fast.</div> <p /><div>Unfortunately for me, there&#39;s no Documentum node.js module (yet) but I&#39;m considering the option of doing one by myself (the only thing that stops me it&#39;s to know that it will be crap, but....) Now, creating a very simple API for Section9 Security was a piece of cake with Node.js (and since there&#39;s a module for MongoDb I managed to do something that works).</div> <p /><div>A fellow developer asked me what to do with node that you could not do with java and my question was a smile. Programming languages are not about what you can do but how easy to do something. The main difference between customizing something like Documentum or Alfresco is how simple and quick is to put Alfresco on steroids and how terribly complex it can be to deal with a monster like documentum webtop.</div> <p /><div>Node it&#39;s about speed writing your code, testing it and delivering. The other reason is cost. To have a VPS with 256Mb of RAM it&#39;s very cheap (~$5/month) but you cannot run websphere there... but you can run apache2 + php or node.js So, from the (super) Enterprise point of view it can be silly to look at technologies like node, but... if I say that instead of having a developer for 3 months you can have it for 2 weeks things are different.</div> <p /><div>Still, I know that using node.js in an enterprise environment is still a bit far (that&#39;s because you talk with IT not with Finance!)</div>
