Yesterday Juliet went to meet the very welcoming <a href="http://friendsofbarlby.co.uk/">Friends of Barlby</a>, while I stayed at home with the children (and my episodes of The Walking Dead). It looks like that they, now we, are trying to find different ways to raise money for Barlby School.<p /><div>Well, here it goes my contribution: Chains Marathon!</div><p /><div>Why chains? well, I&#39;ve spent some time thinking a nice way of raising money with some story (and history) behind: bear in mind that the money is for a school, so children should learn something of all this. Well, a Chain is a unit of measurement (a british one!), so here we go, children can learn some history (and yes, some maths too! ... duh!).</div> <p /><div>Don&#39;t ask me yet How it will be and the route, but I&#39;m pretty confident about the date: the last weekend before summer term (this means early July). Fine, now... can I register? well, indeed you can, as long as you accept the rules (which unfortunately I don&#39;t know yet).</div> <p /><div>One thing is true, a marathon are 2.098 chains, which is the target. Now, if you want to register and participate, you will have to trade pounds for chains. Want to run the whole marathon? inscription is £20.98; not sure about the whole one, but definitely you&#39;re on the half? inscription is £10.49, what about 10K? easy peasy: £4.98... 5K? more maths again: £2.49; Children run: £1</div> <p /><div>So, what do you think? fancy running a marathon while contributing to improve a primary school?</div>
