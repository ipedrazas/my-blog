A few minutes ago it happened one of those things that keep you smiling for days I would dare to say! Because indeed it has happened again.<p /><div>The story is like this: after a very boring and extremely useless meeting I&#39;m headed to the canteen for my afternoon coffee. While waiting to be served I was thinking of what I could do for Nico, because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George's_Day#Catalonia">St. Jordi</a> will be here before we realise and I don&#39;t want to be caught with nothing in my folders... But nothing, just me, my paper cup and a bowl of fruit. Then, snap, my mind jumps to Nico shouting &quot;NANAAAAAAA!&quot; refering to banana. And I smile, and then, and this is the magical moment, while I&#39;m sitting in that almost empty canteen looking through a window I imagine baby Nico with a big huge massive banana.</div> <p /><div>I can visualise his reaction, of course. Then, another snapshot of Nico reading &quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Charlie-Chick-Nick-Denchfield/dp/1405034602">Charlie Chick</a>&quot; byÂ Nick Denchfield and that&#39;s it, a pencil, a dice, a shoe, objects keep popping out of my head and falling to the table to the point my paper cup is knocked over... Got my notebook out, pencil in hand and start sketching. Got it!</div> <p /><div>New project in his way: <b>Little Nico</b>: BIG!</div>
