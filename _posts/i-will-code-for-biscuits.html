This year at FOWD I meet a woman with a very interesting name: <a href="http://www.jokedewinter.co.uk/">Joke De Winter</a>. It&#39;s pretty clear that having this name you have to be funny and cold (I guess that if she had a biscuit for every moron saying this joke she would be now more famose than Mc Vites).<p /><div>Anyway, in the same way that when in Barcelona we had this little private joke about the catalan version of &quot;My Code Works&quot; (<a href="http://www.amiemfunciona.be">www.amiemfunciona.be</a>), with Miss Winter, or Miss Joke or... (you see, it&#39;s not easy not to fall in the quick Joke, -sigh-) we started toying the idea of &quot;I will Code for Biscuits&quot;.</div> <p /><div>Every now and then, those intense cravings come to haunt us and we have to make public our statement, that yes, we are weak, and yes, we will code for biscuits. Now, don&#39;t think every biscuit is worth a jquery function, or even a global variable. There are biscuits and biscuits, so, if you want bespoke homemade code, you will have to provide biscuits that can match the code, even we agree that the challenge is not to bake the perfect biscuits, but to write the perfect code.</div> <p /><div>So, what code would you trade for biscuits?</div>
