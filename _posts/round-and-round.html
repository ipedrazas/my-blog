First we had our blog, then we had our blogs... we added twitter, and for one reason or another, we stopped posting. Then Google+ arrived, and we were posting again (not in our blogs anymore but) in G+.<p /><div> I&#39;ve heard many people saying that the power of G+ is that it engages people easily, that it has the good thing of twitter: getting followers, without the 140 character restriction... Alas, that&#39;s what Blogger almost got it right when they added the &quot;Followers&quot; option.</div> <p /><div>Now, as it turns out, G+ is great because it gives you space to write (notice that not many people complained about not being able to format the text), it gives you the unseen flexibility to manage contacts, friends and people you want to know for one reason or another, and it allows communication (which was the little piece missing from the previous platforms).</div> <p /><div>So, let&#39;s review what we&#39;ve got here: blah, blah, blah: communication, blah, blah...</div><p /><div>As it turns out, that improvement in the communication is what is making G+ differentiate from the others. Why? because Facebook has become our private little world or friends andÂ acquaintances, but it does not provide a way to follow, listen or participate in the way that twitter or G+ does.</div> <p /><div>So all this buzz and the only real great improvement was to make communication easier. Did I say only? it&#39;s precisely these kind of advances what makes internet a very high paced land.</div>
