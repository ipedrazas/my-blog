<p>Last of the latest craziest idea... To make my business cards out of Lego bricks... </p><p /><div>I made two mistakes yesterday, the first one was to suggest my kid to help me out to make my business cards, the second one was to let him to convince me that to do them with Lego would be very cool. I agree, it might be very cool as not very practical, but what the heck, you only live once, and let&#39;s be clear here... how many chances do you have to make your own business cards with bricks?</div>
