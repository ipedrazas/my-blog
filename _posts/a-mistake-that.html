Some time ago I wanted to install my USB wifi dongle in my ubuntu (yes, the zenbook has a crap wireless card with a reach of 2cm...). unfortunately then, I didn&#39;t read very well the results of the command &quot;lsusb&quot; and I ended up installing the driver for the RTL8192CE instead of the RTL8188CE-VAU<p /><div>It didn&#39;t work out and I lost my patience... and some days after I tried again, and read the thing correctly, and installed the right driver and alas... everything worked!</div><p /><div>Thing is... every time I install a new kernel I have to reinstall the dongle driver... I know, I know... and this time I remembered my mistake so I went straight to the RTL8188CE-VAU driver, followed the instructions and... it didn&#39;t worked!!!</div> <p /><div>So, I followed my last steps, downloaded the wrong driver (rtl8192ce) installed and... guess what? it worked!</div><p /><div>It seems that in order to make the (bloody) wifi card you have to install both drivers (don&#39;t ask me, I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t have the time to know why it happens... but it happens!).</div> <p /><div>Oh, yes, worst case is that the drivers of this card are supposedly supported and included in the kernel from 2.6 (I don&#39;t doubt it...) but if you have a wireless card with this chipset and you want to run ubuntu (12.04 at least), you will have this problem (or maybe not, and I&#39;m just been unlucky).</div> <p /><div>Anyway, it works now, and I con go to bed!</div>
