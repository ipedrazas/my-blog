<p>Yesterday while running along the very frozen Grand Union Canal got the idea about running 24 hours. Actually I had the idea before but yesterday the whole thing fell in place.</p> <p>I know I cannot run 24 hours non-stop. Not yet at least, but nevertheless, the whole idea is start running at 7pm and finishing next day. How many miles are left behind is not important, the very important thing is to be able to start and finish.</p> <p>So, it will be in August, surely at the end of the month, the objective will be to raise money for a charity. We&#39;ll see which one is happy to collaborate with me.</p> <p>London 24 hours!</p>
